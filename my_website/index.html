    <h3>I RESCUED HIM BUT HE RESCUED ME TOO!</h3>



    <p> Just over 10 years ago I met the man of my dreams.  This guy NEVER leaves the toilet seat up, and he is always to happy to see me!  He greets me at the door when I come home, and he showers me with kisses.  He watches what ever movies I want to watch and he listens so well.  He's loyal to a fault, but I always know he has got my back, no matter what!  Sounds to good to be true???  Well, unfortunantely, it is.  He does exist, and yes, he is as wonderful as I described, until he decides that the trash is his next conquest.  Or after rolling around in the mud, he figures the only sensible thing to do is jump up on the bed roll around until all the mnud is everywhere but on him!

    You've probably figured out by now, but I am referring to my dog, Jericho, the BEST DOG EVER... or most of the time he!  I adopted him as a puppy from the   <a href="https://www.coloradopuppy.org">Colorado Puppy Rescue.</a>  They are a foster-only, no-kill, non-profit located here in Denver.  They go to the rural areas of Colorado and bring the puppies back to Denver, where they are in High Demand. If anyone is looking into adoping a furry friend, I highly recommend them.  You can check them out here, and for those of you ready to take the plunge now, or if yiou want to do some reasearch of your own, I compiled a list of animal shelters in the Denver metro area.  You can find them at the bottom of this page, along with links to their websites.

    Adopting Jericho was one of the best decisions I ever made.  I held off for a very long time because I was not sure if I was ready for that kind of responsibility.  My advice to eveyone is, if you're having any doubts, wait, don't do it until it feels right.  I feel it was meant to be.  I waited until I knew for sure that I was ready, and the Universe thanked me.  I can honnestly say that even though I technically rescued him, he is my Hero who comes to my rescue on regular basis.
